"""The HTTP layer: `ThreadingHTTPServer`, stdlib only.

## Why not aiohttp any more

Two reasons, and the second is the one that decides it.

The agent runs in this process now and `run_conversation` BLOCKS, so on an event
loop every turn would have to be handed to an executor and every callback
handed back across `call_soon_threadsafe` — a thread boundary in the middle of
the hottest path, for a server whose concurrency is a handful of turns. A
thread-per-request server has the agent, its callbacks and the SSE writer all on
one thread, and the boundary disappears.

The deciding reason: importing `run_agent` means running inside HERMES' venv,
and hermes' own session bridge exists precisely because "the two venvs share
most of their packages and disagree on some". aiohttp was this server's ONLY
third-party import. Without it there is nothing left to disagree about.

## What this module is not

No routing framework, no middleware stack — a dict of handlers and two checks
that run before them. The handlers themselves live where their logic does; this
file is the transport.
