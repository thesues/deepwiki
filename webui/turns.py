"""Starting, tracking and stopping turns — the piece the HTTP layer talks to.

Two admission rules, and they refuse for different reasons because the client
does different things with each:

* **taken** — this CONVERSATION is already replying. The message was never read
  by a model, so the client must be able to put it back in the composer rather
  than believe it was sent.
* **busy** — this ENDPOINT is at capacity. A backstop: the client is told the
  limit by `/api/sessions` and blocks its own composer, so reaching here is a
  race, not the normal path.

The limit is per endpoint because the real ceiling is the model behind it. A
24 GB card running `--max-running-requests 1` and whatever serves the next
endpoint are different numbers, and one global limit can only be right for one
of them.

`run_conversation` blocks, so a turn occupies a thread for its whole life —
but it runs on `_TurnPool`, a fixed set of daemon workers sized to the
admission budget (Σ `max_concurrent`), not a fresh `threading.Thread` per
turn. Daemon on purpose: `concurrent.futures` workers are non-daemon and
joined at interpreter exit on 3.9+ (bpo-39812), and a rollout's SIGTERM must
drop an in-flight turn, not wait out the approval timeout it may be parked
in. Admission still counts live turns per endpoint — the pool buys reuse and
a named worker set, it is not the limit.

        That setter stores the callback in a `threading.local` — deliberately,
        it is a fix for concurrent ACP sessions sharing one slot — and hermes
        dispatches tools on threads of its own. The callback was therefore
        invisible to the thread that actually asked, hermes fell through to its
        `input()` fallback, and that spawns a daemon thread reading a stdin no
        one will ever type into. Measured: a turn stopped at
        `terminal / running`, emitted nothing for minutes, held the endpoint's
        only slot, and `interrupt()` could not touch it because interrupt sets
        a flag the conversation loop reads and the loop was never reached. The
        module's own comment calls this "an invisible 60s deadlock".

        The gateway path is module-global instead: the session key is a
        contextvar (inherited by threads hermes spawns), the pending entry goes
        into `_gateway_queues`, and `resolve_gateway_approval` unblocks it from
        whichever thread the HTTP handler happens to be on. This is what
        hermes-webui does, for the same reason.

        `HERMES_GATEWAY_SESSION` is the switch `_is_gateway_approval_context()`
        reads; `HERMES_INTERACTIVE` tells the non-interactive auto-approve path
