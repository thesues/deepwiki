"""One turn's event log — sequence-numbered, bounded, replayable, thread-safe.

Ported from the asyncio version unchanged in SEMANTICS and changed in exactly
one mechanism: the wake-up. The agent now runs on a worker thread and calls the
callbacks from there, while readers sit in their own request threads, so the
`asyncio.Event` that used to be replaced on every emit becomes a
`threading.Condition`. Everything a reader depends on — monotonic `seq`,
read-from-your-own-seq, the eviction gap, the terminal event ordering — is the
same, and the tests below pin each of those rather than the mechanism.

Why a shared condition rather than a queue per subscriber: subscribers re-read
from their own `seq`, so the notification carries no data and a queue would only
add a second place for the two to disagree about what has been delivered.
