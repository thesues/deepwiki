"""The API, wired onto the transport.

Only wiring lives here: every rule it enforces belongs to `turns`,
`hermes_agent` or `sse`, and every one of those is tested on its own. What this
file owns is the JSON shapes the client already speaks, which are kept
unchanged — the point of the refactor is that the browser cannot tell.

Two contracts worth restating because they are easy to break silently:

* `taken` and `busy` are DIFFERENT refusals. `taken` means this conversation is
  already replying and the text was never read by a model, so the client must be
  able to put it back in the composer. `busy` means the endpoint is at capacity.
* Reading a transcript never touches the agent. Under ACP the only way to read
  one was `session/load`, which MOVED the single agent process — so looking at
  another conversation while one streamed yanked the agent out from under the
  turn in flight. Reading goes to the store, so viewing is free.
