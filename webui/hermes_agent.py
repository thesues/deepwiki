"""hermes as a LIBRARY — `run_agent.AIAgent` in this process, no ACP subprocess.

## Why this replaces the ACP client

The ACP adapter shipped inside hermes is a thin wrapper: for one turn it sets
five callback attributes on an `AIAgent` and calls `run_conversation`. It adds
no capability this server did not already have access to — and it REMOVES one.
`AIAgent.switch_model(model, provider, api_key, base_url, api_mode)` and the
`base_url` setter exist on the object; ACP exposes neither. `session/set_model`
is a name in the ACP schema with no handler behind it, `hermes acp` takes no
`--model`, and the model list a session advertises comes from a curated
per-provider table that never reads `custom_providers`.

That absence is what forced "one model per process": a second endpoint meant a
second `hermes acp` with its own HERMES_HOME, hence its own session store, hence
two disjoint conversation lists for what is one application. Talking to the
library directly, an endpoint is just another cache key.

What else goes away with the subprocess: the JSON-RPC framing and its pending
map, the respawn/reconnect logic, `session/cancel not honoured in 12s —
restarting hermes acp` (there is `agent.interrupt()`), the 1.3 s `session/load`
warm-up, and the history-replay protocol that made the same prompt render twice.

## What this module owns, and what it does NOT

Persistence stays hermes'. `run_conversation` writes the turn through
`agent._persist_session` into `state.db`; nothing here does. Reading is the
caller's job — `turn_context.py` starts a turn with
`messages = list(conversation_history) if conversation_history else []`, so a
turn given nothing is a turn with no history, silently. `history_for` is that
read, and it goes straight to `SessionDB` now that this process runs inside
hermes' interpreter.

The agent cache is an OPTIMISATION, never a source of truth. Evicting one costs
the ~1.3 s rebuild and nothing else: a fresh agent recomputes `_user_turn_count`
from the history it is handed. It is capped because each live agent pins a
conversation transcript in RAM.
