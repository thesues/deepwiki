"""Point hermes at the MCP server, through its config file.

Why the config file and not ACP `session/new {mcpServers: [...]}`: the config
shape `mcp_servers.<name>.url` is the one hermes' own tests exercise for an
HTTP-transport server, and it applies to EVERY session including ones loaded
from history. The ACP parameter's HTTP form was not verified against this
hermes build, and guessing a wire shape that silently parses to "no servers"
would look exactly like a working deploy with an agent that has no tools —
the failure mode this whole decoupling exists to avoid.

Written without pyyaml on purpose: it is not guaranteed present in the runtime,
and a missing import here would degrade into "chat works, retrieval silently
does not". hermes writes a plain block-style mapping, so an indentation-aware
edit is enough and dependency-free. The same reasoning the console applied to
reading the `model:` block.

Toolsets live in the SAME file, under `platform_toolsets.cli` — the key
hermes' own CLI reads for itself (see `resolve_toolsets` below). One file owns
what a session can do; the env vars that used to drive this directly are
seeds, not sources.

# patch_acp_toolsets.py as belt-and-braces for the retired ACP path; it no
# longer gates anything here.
#
# What config.yaml IS still needed for: the same `mcp_servers` block both
# names the `mcp-<name>` toolsets (the resolver appends them) and connects
# the servers (`register_mcp_servers` at startup). Either alone yields an
# agent with no retrieval — see W10.
