// The endpoint picker is the front half of the multi-endpoint feature; the
// back half (`/api/chat/start {endpoint}`) has its own tests in
// test_app_routes.py. This replays the picker's two decision rules against
// the exact sequences that broke them before they were rules:
//
//   1. THE SAVED CHOICE SURVIVES RELOAD — localStorage outlives the page, and
//      a reader who picked an endpoint, reloaded, and got silently dropped to
//      the default would send to a model that is not the one on screen.
//   2. A STALE SAVED KEY FALLS BACK — the server's endpoint list changes
//      without telling the browser (a redeploy with DEEPWIKI_ENDPOINTS edited).
//      A saved key that is no longer advertised must resolve to the default,
//      not to a 404-shaped silence on every send.
//
// Plus the capacity rule setBusy() copies: a FULL endpoint must not block a
// send aimed at ANOTHER one — the limit belongs to the model behind the
// choice, which is the entire reason the limits are per endpoint.
//
// With ABLATE=1 every guard is off, which is the behaviour before the rules:
// the saved key is ignored, the stale key 404s into the default's arms, and
// one full endpoint greys out the whole composer.

// 5. An already-resolved choice is not re-resolved off a poll that lacks the
//    saved key in ITS payload — every loadSessions() response passes through
//    here, and re-resolving on each poll would unseat the reader's pick.

//    default is what the last PICK set, not what some other session uses.
