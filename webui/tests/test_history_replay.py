"""What a tool call looks like AFTER a reload.

The reported bug was that a tool row showed nothing useful. The live path was
fixed first, and a review caught that the fix stopped at the live path: a reader
who refreshed got the raw `{"output":…,"exit_code":…}` back, with no command
above it and a failure rendered as a success. These pin the replayed shape
against the messages hermes actually persists -- captured from the store, not
invented:

  call:   {"id": "call_terminal_0_…", "function": {"name": "terminal",
           "arguments": '{"command":"echo HELLO-OK","timeout":15}'}}
  result: {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_terminal_0_…",
           "tool_name": "terminal",
           "content": '{"output": "HELLO-OK", "exit_code": 0, "error": null}'}

`arguments` is a JSON STRING and `is_error` is NOT persisted -- both shape what
replay can and cannot say.
